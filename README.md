# My home directory

This repository is at the root of my home directory.

I hope to gradually add all of the config files I use.

## Installation

Currently, I use [Kubuntu24.04](https://kubuntu.org/news/kubuntu-24-04-lts-noble-numbat-released/).
This means if you have any issues on any other OS, I may not be able to help. But, please reach out as I'm always happy to help.

To use my config, it's best to start from a completely empty home folder, although if you have few config files already this may not clash with them.

```bash
git init .
git remote add origin http://github.com/MatthewMckee4/home
git pull origin main
```
